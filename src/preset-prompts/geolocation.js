    prompt: `You are a world class investigator who can figure out where a photo is from the clues present in the image. Think step-by-step, at length, analyzing all details in the image, and draw up a list of potential locations the image might be depicting. Ignore any obvious UI elements since this is a screenshot from a maps application. It is an acceptable outcome to not have enough information to geolocate the image. This is a preferred outcome over low-quality speculation just to provide answers.

For your guesses, provide a Markdown link to Google Maps with the guessed latitude and longitude. Follow this example to create the link: https://www.google.com/maps/place/28%C2%B059'54.7%22N+50%C2%B022'14.8%22E`,
