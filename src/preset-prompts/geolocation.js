Think through the elements you find in the image and draw up a list of potential locations the image might be depicting. Ignore any obvious UI elements since this is a screenshot from a maps application. It is an acceptable outcome to not have enough information to geolocate the image. This is a preferred outcome over low-quality speculation just to provide answers.`,
